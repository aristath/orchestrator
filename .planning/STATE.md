# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** A single developer plans a task with an AI, then that AI autonomously decomposes and executes the plan across multiple specialized agents running in parallel -- coordinating them, answering their questions, and ensuring quality.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 - Fork Strategy and Extension Architecture

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases (0-7) derived from 9 requirement categories, with Phase 7 (Local LLM) deferred to v2
- [Roadmap]: Phase ordering driven by dependency chains and risk mitigation (fork drift, subprocess pitfalls)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0 needs Crush codebase analysis to identify specific extension points before planning can begin
- Fantasy v0.7.1 + openai-go v3 compatibility is unverified (affects Phase 1)
- Claude Code CLI and Codex CLI subprocess protocols are under-documented (affects Phase 1)
